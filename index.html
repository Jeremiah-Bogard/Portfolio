        <h2>About</h2>
        
        <p>Hi my name is Jeremiah, I've been programming since 2019. I am home-schooled and used Khan Academy to help me learn. Because of this I found out about computer programming. At first I was just doing it to count as school, then I got the hang of it and decided that it was the coolest thing ever. So I continued in the course and did my own research screw stack Overflow and of course YouTube. Unfortunately I did not know any other programmers. However, this did not stop me. I continued to learn and pursue the path of a full-stack web developer.</p>

        <h3>How I Taught Myself</h3>
        <p>Like most people I learned through YouTube. The most useful person I found through that goes by the YouTube name of Web Dev Simplified. I would recommend him to every Web Developer I know. However, I did not just use YouTube to learn. I also took free online courses provided by individuals and companies. The most common ones being Free Code Camp and Khan Academy.</p>
        
        <h3>Certificates</h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/JeremiahB/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a>

        <h3>How I picked my languages</h3>
        
        <p>Because I do not know any other programmers I had to figure out the best roadmap for learning to become a full-stack web developer. I used resources like Free Code Camp, Stack Overflow, and YouTube. I used this knowledge to decide which languages I should use for my future career in Web Development. These languages were node.js, react.js, SQL, MongoDB,  and of course HTML,  CSS, and Javascript.</p>
